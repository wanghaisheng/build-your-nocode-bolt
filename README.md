# BoltNext - AI-Powered Full Stack Web App Generator

BoltNext is a cutting-edge application that allows you to build full-stack web applications using the power of AI. By simply chatting with the AI.

This project is a Next.js-based reimagining of [bolt](https://github.com/stackblitz/bolt.new), which was originally built using Vite and Remix. BoltNext aims to provide a similar experience with the benefits of Next.js and tailwind, such as server-side rendering and improved performance.

## Features

*   **AI-Powered Code Generation:** Chat with the AI to describe your desired application, and BoltNext will generate the necessary code.
*   **Mobile Responsive:** Allow use of bolt on various screen sizes.
*   **Full-Stack Development:** Build complete web applications, including frontend and backend components.
*   **Multiple AI Provider Support:** Choose from various AI providers like Anthropic, Google, and TogetherAI.
*   **Interactive Chat Interface:** A user-friendly chat interface for interacting with the AI.
*   **Customizable Sidebar:** A sidebar for navigation, model selection, and managing chat history.
*   **Real-time Updates:** The application auto-updates as you make changes.

## Project Structure

*   `app/`: Contains the main application logic, including pages and layouts.
*   `components/`: Contains reusable UI components and some main application logic.
*   `lib/`: Contains utility functions, stores, and other shared logic.
*   `persistance/`: Contains database related logic.
*   `public/`: Contains static assets like fonts and images.

## Key Components

*   **`app/layout.tsx`:** (startLine: 1, endLine: 49) The root layout of the application, including the sidebar and main content area.
*   **`app/page.tsx`:** (startLine: 1, endLine: 21) The main page of the application, which includes the chat interface.
